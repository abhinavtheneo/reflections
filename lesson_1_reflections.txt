How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
It helped me identifying the lines where we made changes & it helped me to check the potential errors.    


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
If we make occasional mistakes (which we will), then its better to restore it to previous working version
if we have the entire history of a file.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
pros - more convenient, resposibility of user, less no of commits most likely so clean history
cons - might not be logically separated commits, 


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
If files are interrelated then its better to allow saving multiple files in one commit.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log | grep "anything"
git diff <commit_id_1> <commit_id_2>
git show <commit_id>


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
We can always go back to previous working code without any hassle.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Use it for every code related work whether big or small.
